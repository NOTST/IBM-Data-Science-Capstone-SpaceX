# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-SpaceX-
The presentation in this project are summarized in *00 SpaceX Final Presentation.pdf*

**This project aims to find the factor for successful rocket landing and the model to predict the result. The methodologies has shown below**

**Data collection:** use the SpaceX REST API and Web Scraping

**Data wrangling:** prepare data and create success/unsuccessful outcome variable 

**Exploratory data analysis:** data visualization techniques and SQL. Factors: payload, launch site, and flight number

**Folium:** launch site success rate and proximity to geographical markers

**Plotly Dash:** launch sites with success launches and successful payload ranges  

**Classification Models:** predict landing outcome using logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), decision tree and K-nearest neighbor (KNN)

**Results**

**Exploratory data analysis results**

New launches have a higher success rate

KSC LC-39A has the highest successful rate with 76.9%

100% success rate: ES-L1, GEO, HEO, and SSO

**Interactive analytics results**

All launch sites are in very close proximity to the coast to the Equator line

**Predictive analysis results**

The decision tree model is the best model
